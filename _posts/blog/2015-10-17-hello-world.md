## Hello World!

From today I will start working on this little site powered by Jekyll and built on GitHub. I don't use MarkDown regularly but this would be a good opportunity to learn. I will merge some of the useful contents on my [current blog](http://y234.lamost.org) (established in 2002, to be closing down soon) to here.
