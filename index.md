## Hi there!

### My name is Quanzhi, you can just call me QZ. I am a postdoctoral astronomer at Caltech/IPAC. I am interested in the small bodies of the solar system, such as asteroids, comets and meteoroids.

I use the 1.2-m Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory as well as a range of worldwide facilities in the GROWTH consortium to study the population of asteroids and comets in our solar system. Apart from my day (night) work, I am an avid stargazer and plays string instrument in orchestras and chamber music groups.
