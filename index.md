## Hi there!

#### My name is Quanzhi, you can just call me QZ. I am a postdoctoral astronomer at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/)/[IPAC](http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/). I am interested in the small bodies of the solar system, such as asteroids, comets and meteoroids.

I use the [1.2-m Samuel Oschin telescope](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/oschin.html) at [Palomar Observatory](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/homepage.html) as well as a range of worldwide facilities in the [GROWTH consortium](http://growth.caltech.edu/) to study the population of asteroids and comets in our solar system. Apart from my day (night) work, I am an avid stargazer and plays string instrument in orchestras and chamber music groups.

### My Name

`
Different from the western naming order, Chinese names follow the surname-given name order. Hence, my name should be written as Ye Quanzhi, where Ye (pronounced as "Yeh") is my surname and Quanzhi (pronounced as Ch'Ã¼an Chih) is my given name.

"Ye" means "leaf" in Chinese. The surname originated as a clan name after the [Duke of Ye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Ye), the Prime Minister of the State of Chu (today's lower Yangtze River area, including Shanghai) at about 500 BCE.
