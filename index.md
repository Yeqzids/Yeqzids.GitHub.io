## Hi there!

### My name is Quanzhi, you can just call me QZ. I am an astronomer at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/)/[IPAC](http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/). I am mostly interested in the small stuff in our Solar System, namely asteroids, comets and meteoroids (which fathered meteors).

For the most part of my work, I use the data collected by the [Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/) at [Palomar Observatory](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/homepage.html) to chase small asteroids that zip past our Earth, and to understand why and how comets get excited. I also use a range of worldwide facilities provided by the [GROWTH consortium](http://growth.caltech.edu/) to study these intriguing objects.

Outside of my work, I enjoy going out for (non-for-work) stargazing. I also love playing violin/viola/cello in orchestras and chamber music groups.

## Outreach

In addition to research, I also love doing public outreach. I have been writing for magazines, blogs and giving talks since high school, and still enjoy doing it after earning my Ph.D. Most of my outreach work was done in my home country (China). After I move to the

## Miscellaneous

* I am really happy to receive the naming of asteroid [(10280) Yequanzhi](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=10280;old=0;orb=1;cov=0;log=0;cad=0#orb), courtesy of [Dr. Schelte J. "Bobby" Bus](https://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/sjb/default/bus.shtml)! Thank you Bobby!
* I considered myself very fortunate to have co-discovered [comet C/2007 N3 (Lulin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Lulin), the naked-eye comet in 2009, with highly acclaimed Taiwanese astrophotographer Mr. Chi Sheng Lin: [Spaceweather.com gallery](http://www.spaceweather.com/comets/gallery_lulin.htm).

    * "Wonders of the Universe" by Brian Cox [Amazon China]
* Guest blogs at the Planetary Society

#### My Name

> Different from the western naming order, Chinese names follow the surname-given name order. Hence, my name should be written as Ye Quanzhi, where Ye (pronounced as "Yeh") is my surname and Quanzhi (pronounced as Ch'Ã¼an Chih) is my given name.

> "Ye" means "leaf" in Chinese. The surname originated as a clan name after the [Duke of Ye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Ye), the Prime Minister of the State of Chu (today's lower Yangtze River area, including Shanghai) at about 500 BCE.
