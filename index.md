## Hi there!

### My name is Quanzhi, you can just call me QZ<sub>[[What is my name then?](#my-name)]</sub>. I am an astronomer at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/)/[IPAC](http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/). I am mostly interested in the small stuff in our Solar System, namely asteroids, comets and meteoroids (which fathered meteors).

For the most part of my work, I use the [1.2-m Samuel Oschin telescope](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/oschin.html) at [Palomar Observatory](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/homepage.html) to chase small asteroids that zip past our Earth, and to understand why and how comets get excited. I also use a range of worldwide facilities provided by the [GROWTH consortium](http://growth.caltech.edu/) to study these intriguing objects.

Outside my work, I enjoy going out for (non-work-related) stargazing. I also love play violin/viola/cello in orchestras and/or chamber music groups.

#### My Name

> Different from the western naming order, Chinese names follow the surname-given name order. Hence, my name should be written as Ye Quanzhi, where Ye (pronounced as "Yeh") is my surname and Quanzhi (pronounced as Ch'Ã¼an Chih) is my given name.

> "Ye" means "leaf" in Chinese. The surname originated as a clan name after the [Duke of Ye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Ye), the Prime Minister of the State of Chu (today's lower Yangtze River area, including Shanghai) at about 500 BCE.
