## Hi there!

### My name is Quanzhi, you can just call me QZ. I am an astronomer at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/)/[IPAC](http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/). I am mostly interested in the small stuff in our Solar System, namely asteroids, comets and meteoroids (which fathered meteors).

For the most part of my work, I use the data collected by the [Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/) at [Palomar Observatory](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/homepage.html) to chase small asteroids that zip past our Earth, and to understand why and how comets get excited. I also use a range of worldwide facilities provided by the [GROWTH consortium](http://growth.caltech.edu/) to study these intriguing objects.

Outside of my work, I enjoy going out for (non-for-work) stargazing. I also love playing violin/viola/cello in music groups of variable sizes.

## Outreach

In addition to research, I also love doing outreach. I have written many articles for magazines/blogs and given talks since high school, and still enjoy reaching out to the general public after earning my Ph.D. Most of my outreach work was done in my home country (China). Unsurprisingly, doing outreach in western countries is hugely different from what I have done in China! But I have since found my niche on promoting the communication between China and the West.

Some of my recent outreach works with connection to English-speaking audience:

* [Guest blogs at the Planetary Society, introducing recent Chinese space activities to the West](http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/?author_profile=325290428&topics=&dateType=firstPublicationDate&startDate=&endDate=)
* Appearance on [Spacepod #103: meteor showers and "broom stars" with Dr. Ye](https://www.listentospacepod.com/episodes/2017/7/16/103-meteor-showers-and-broom-stars-with-dr-ye)
* Appearance on [Astrotalk UK #75: China - back to the Moon with Chang'e 4](https://astrotalkuk.org/episode-75-china-back-to-the-moon-with-chang-e-4/)
    
If you are curious on how much less awkward (?) I am on Mandarin-speaking podcasts, here you go:

* [MounStar Talk Show #194: Geminid meteor shower](https://player.fm/series/series-106962/no194)
* [MounStar Talk Show #196: interstellar asteroid `Oumuamua](https://player.fm/series/series-106962/no196-oumuamua)

## Miscellaneous

* I am really happy to receive the naming of asteroid [(10280) Yequanzhi](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=10280;old=0;orb=1;cov=0;log=0;cad=0#orb), courtesy of [Dr. Schelte J. "Bobby" Bus](https://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/sjb/default/bus.shtml)! Thank you Bobby!
* I was very fortunate to have co-discovered [comet C/2007 N3 (Lulin)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Lulin), the naked-eye comet in 2009, with highly acclaimed Taiwanese astrophotographer Mr. Chi Sheng Lin: [Spaceweather.com gallery](http://www.spaceweather.com/comets/gallery_lulin.htm).

#### My Name

> Chinese names are written in surname-first order, and strictly speaking, this rule also applies to their English counterparts ([in accordance to P.R. China Standard GB/T 28039-2011](http://www.moe.gov.cn/ewebeditor/uploadfile/2015/01/13/20150113091249368.pdf); however, apart from usage in legal documents and media reports, in daily practice this rule has not been strictly observed). Hence, my name should really be written as Ye Quanzhi, where Ye (pronounced as "Yeh") is my surname and Quanzhi (pronounced as Ch'Ã¼an Chih) is my given name.

> "Ye" means "leaf" in Chinese. Ye is also romanized "Yeh", "Yip", "Ip", "Jip" in different spelling systems and variety of spoken Chinese (e.g. Cantonese). The surname originated as a clan name after the [Duke of Ye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Ye), the Prime Minister of the [State of Chu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_(state)) (today's lower Yangtze River area, including Shanghai) at circa 500 BCE. Confucius visited the Duke of Ye in 489 BCE, and their conversations were recorded in [The Analects](https://ctext.org/analects/zi-lu) (note that the title of the Duke was spelled as the Duke of She in The Analects).
